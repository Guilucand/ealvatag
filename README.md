ealvatag
========

*ealvatag* is a Java API for reading and writing tag information of audio 
files. The follow types are currently supported:

- Mp3
- Flac
- OggVorbis
- Mp4
- Aiff
- Wav
- Wma
- Dsf

Until the version of this library reaches 1.0, you should consider the API to 
be very unstable (no Semantic Versioning until 1.0.0 and later). Currently there is no downloadable jar. Pull requests 
welcome.

History
-------

This library started as Entagged Audio Tag library which was forked into 
[Jaudiotagger][1]. Jaudiotagger is still under active development at this time 
(January 2017)

Jaudiotagger was forked into this library, ealvatag for 2 primary reasons: to
upgrade the license to GNU LGPLv3 and to focus on Android compatibility. 
GNU LGPLv3 is necessary to link to Apache License Version 2.0 libraries. As for
Android compatibility, the previous library was dependent on java.nio library
components not available on Android versions in current use. Also, quite a bit
of refactoring is needed so the library is more [performant][2] on the Android
platform.
